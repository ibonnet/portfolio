# Data Journalism Repository
This repository contains data and code used to generate graphs for journalism articles. The goal of this project is to provide an overview of my skills in data visualization to support my job applications.

## Data Sources
The data used in these graphs comes from a variety of sources, including government agencies, non-profit organizations, and private companies. All data sources are cited in the corresponding article and linked to where possible.

## Data Processing
The code used to process the data and generate the graphs is written in Javascript and Python, using various libraries such as Pandas, d3.js, Matplotlib, and more.

## Graphs
The graphs included in this repository are visualizations of the data used in the corresponding journalism articles. The graphs are generated using the code in this repository and can be reproduced using the same data and code.
